- Infer what to implement from what's under the cursor
- Infer where in the class to place the method
- Read projections
- Research rails.vim projections
- Implement different kinds of routes

- Implement utility functions to "inject" a method, create a class. Think well about the interface: flags, options, different functions for different cases?
